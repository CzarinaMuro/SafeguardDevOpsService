# Safeguard DevOps Service

This project is currently in *technology preview*. It should not be used for any
production environment.

It is still in the *proof of concept* stages. The plugin interface is still being
developed and *may be changed*.

There are many security considerations that have not yet been addressed.

More documentation will be provided in the near future.

Feedback welcome.
